Things To Do
------------
 * make sure this works as expected by running it on a fresh VM
 * make sure running the script twice isn't different from running it once
 * make sure things simple things are aliases, medium complexity things are functions and very complex things are scripts
 * make sure everything is well commented
 * generalize the format of the script with variables and such so other people can easily use it too
